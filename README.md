Distributed Gossip Membership Protocol: 
The objective of this project was to implement a membership protocol on a distributed system environment. 
It required that:
i) Every non-faulty process must detect every node join, failure, and leave nodes and 
ii) Accuracy of node failure detection when there are message delays and message losses.
It was implemented over an emulated distributed cluster network API, but tested over a real cluster for final grade, where it passed 100% 
of tests. It was part of a Cloud Computing Concepts, online course taught by Illinois university.
C/C++, Distributed systems, asynchronous programing.
